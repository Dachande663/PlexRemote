h1. Plex Remote for OS X

Plex Remote provides a very simple interface for controlling a Plex Client on another machine from your menubar. This software is currently at a very early stage, so you will need Xcode installed and expect to break things.

Important note: Until I add a proper preferences panel, you must set the Client Name in PlexRemoteAppDelegate.m and build from there. This means you must have Xcode installed!

h2. Still To Add

* Close panel on lose focus
* Add preferences panel to select client
* Make the UI nice
* Handle connections better when waiting
